# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of customer churn with respect to payment methods, showing that automatic payments (bank transfer, credit card) lead to lower churn rates, while electronic check users have the highest churn. Includes a Jupyter notebook, visualizations, and a report with insights and recommendations for customer retention.
